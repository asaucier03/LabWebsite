## Goals
My current academic goals are to continue working hard through my senior year. I am working on my senior thesis and hope that it goes well and I have a successful project to present at the URC.

## Education
I am currently getting my degree in Biology with a Sustainability dual major. 

## Experience
On campus I work in the Honors Office as a front desk assistant. For the past two summers I have worked seasonally at Rocky Neck State Park back home in CT. I work in the campground and as a coordinator for the parks educational programs.
